# PocketFlow Java

This is a Java port of the original [Python version](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow) - a minimalist LLM framework in 100 lines. 

This is only an initial pass. Currently, it doesn't support async. We need volunteer to contribute and maintain the project.

To compile: 

```bash
mvn compile
```

To test: 

```
mvn test
```
